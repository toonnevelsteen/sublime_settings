# Package Syncing

Keep your different Sublime Test installations synchronised across different machines. This idea of the package came by reading the article on [sublime.wbond.net](https://sublime.wbond.net/docs/syncing), so you could use the manual way or simple using this package. 

The package is using a different attempt rather than just build a link. It is basically syncing your user folder and you can define which files you would like to include in the sync. On the other hand you can also exclude files from the sync for example for platform depending settings or packages.

## Functions

- Synchronise your settings, keymaps, builds (adjust able via the settings)
- Automatically install and remove packages between different machines

## Usage

Dropbox is a great choice for syncing settings but other services like Google Drive, or SkyDrive are also working fine. Just pick your personal favourite.

### First Machine

On your first machine you just have to set a proper sync folder and Package Syncing will simple save all selected files in this folder.

### Second Machine (or after a fresh installation)

On your second machine please wait until all files are available and then you simple have to set the sync folder and Package Syncing will automatically pull all available files from that folder. This following message dialog should appear which you just have to confirm.

After a **restart** of Sublime Text Package Control will check for missing packages and install them automatically. From now on everything should work very smoothly.

### Requirements

In order to use get the benefit of automatic installation of packages across the different machines [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net) is basically required.

## Under the Hood

Package Syncing will keep your settings up to date across different machines by checking regular your user and remote directory for updates. The defaults interval is 1 second, if you should have any performance issues you can increase this time via the settings and a restart of Sublime Text.

## Demo

An example sync between two machines; on the top Sublime Text 3 on Windows (as virtual machine) and on the bottom on OS X.
